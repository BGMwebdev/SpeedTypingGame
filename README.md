## Introduction
<hr>
Welcome to the Speed Typing Game. A game with educational purpose, for anyone who aims to become a faster typer, but also just for the fun of it. Type as many of the 6-letter words that are shown, as you can, in 60 seconds. There is a direct feedbackloop when the letters are typed, through colouring of the letters, either red or green. When you have finished you can get your score by email or try again immediately. But be careful, it's addictive! This game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Design choices
For the design I choose to keep it minimalistic. A bright blue color with a broken white contrasting color. For the Font I picked 'Chakra Petch', which I feel go really well with the theme, speed typing. It has this 80/90's-game-vibe to it which takes me back to old sega racing games. The color green on the buttons asks for action. Green is go! which made it an obvious choice for me. I wanted to keep the game in the center of the page and not take more space, as the focus needs to be in the center, where the words will be presented.<hr> 

### Features for the future
- I would like to add feedback through sound. For example, every 5th word you would hear something like "great", "well done", "you're on fire".
- It would be nice to have a certificate send to your email with an everage typing speed which you can use to show off you skills, on LinkedIn for example. 
- Also a difficulty level could be added, by taking out the colouring feedback loop. That way you wouldn't see mistakes turn up red or correct answers green.

### Languages used
For this educational project I used HTML, CSS and a main focus on Javascript.

### Testing
- #### Responsive design
    - This website is tested for responsive design through the use of different size settings in chrome dev-tools and its device toolbar.
    - Responsivity is also tested on http://ami.responsivedesign.is/ (see image at the top of the page in the introduction and down here) and on https://www.responsinator.com/ where also different viewport sizes are presented.
    - The smallest functional size is 260x540px. With a smaller size, elements will start to overlap.
